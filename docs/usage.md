### Select Service Type and Submit Request

From the **Select Service** dropdown, you can choose two options.

* *Single Plant Analysis* will analyze images of a single plant and generate features and statistics of that plant
* *Multi Plant Analysis* will analyze images of multiple plants at once and give a comparison of plant statistics across all plants. This option is chosen by default if not selected.

After selecting the service type, you will be prompted to enter the folder path to input images. The expected structure of the input folder is as below

<img src="./images/plants_folder.png" alt="drawing" width="100"/>

Here, raw images of each plant are separated into different folders. Image names of a plant in its folder should be named in sorted order so that the order can be used to stitch the images later to generate a single stitched image per plant.

If the selected service type is *Single Plant Analysis*, enter the folder path of one plant that contains its images. For *Multi Plant Analysis*, enter the path to the directory containing multiple plant directories as shown above.

After entering the folder path, you can click **Submit Input Folder Path** and you will be asked to choose some options to display additional images in the analysis.

*Show Raw Images* will display the input raw images. *Show Color Images* will display the input images after converting them to color. These options can be used for inspection if necessary.

Upon choosing options, click **Submit** which submits the request to the host server. A textbox will be displayed saying the number of plants being analyzed.

From the **Select Plant** dropdown, you can select the plant name to show plant analysis. Plant analysis has 2 tabs by default. If the *Show Raw Images* or *Show Color Images* options are chosen before, additional tabs will be displayed accordingly. In this case, as we chose both options, 4 tabs are displayed.

* *Raw Input Images* displays the input images to the pipeline
